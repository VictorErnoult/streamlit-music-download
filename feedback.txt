- pressing enter in the url input field does not trigger anything
- the individual download buttons's colors do not change to green when download has been launched
- the url input field is outlined in red when focused. it should be blue instead

Questions

- why do we need to download the playlist twice? once in the tool, then once locally, can't this be done just once somehow?
